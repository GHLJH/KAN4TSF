# KAN4TSF

KAN4TSF is an official PyTorch implementation of [KAN4TSF: Are KAN and KAN-based models Effective for Time Series Forecasting?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11306)
Although it is called KAN4TSF, it also supports time series forecasting methods of various network structures (CNN, Linear, Transformer and others).
